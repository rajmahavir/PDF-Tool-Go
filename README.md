## Development

### Building

```bash
go build -o pdf-tools .
```

### Running Tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Configuration

The server runs on port 8080 by default and listens on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0).

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)

### File Upload Limits

- Maximum file size: 50 MB per PDF
- Supported format: PDF only

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Home page |
| `/merge` | GET | Merge PDFs page |
| `/remove` | GET | Remove pages page |
| `/credits` | GET | Credits and about page |
| `/pdfinfo` | POST | Get PDF page count and metadata |
| `/merge-pdfs` | POST | Merge two PDF files |
| `/remove-pages` | POST | Remove pages from a PDF |

## Security & Privacy

- **No Data Storage**: Files are processed in temporary directories and deleted immediately
- **No Tracking**: No cookies, analytics, or user data collection
- **No Registration**: No user accounts or authentication required
- **Local Processing**: All PDF operations happen on the server, files are never uploaded to third parties
- **Secure**: Input validation and file type checking on all uploads

## Performance

- Fast PDF processing using native Go libraries
- Efficient memory management with automatic cleanup
- Handles PDFs up to 50MB
- Optimized for concurrent requests

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Guidelines

- Follow Go best practices and conventions
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits clean and descriptive

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors, try:

```bash
go mod tidy
go clean -modcache
go build .
```

### Port Already in Use

If port 8080 is already in use, modify the port in `main.go` or set the `PORT` environment variable.

### Network Access Issues

To access from other devices on your network, ensure:
1. The server is running on 0.0.0.0 (default)
2. Your firewall allows connections on port 8080
3. You're using your computer's IP address, not localhost
